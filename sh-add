     sssshh--aadddd adds private key identities to the authentication agent,
     ssh-agent(1).  When run without arguments, it adds the files
     _~_/_._s_s_h_/_i_d___r_s_a, _~_/_._s_s_h_/_i_d___d_s_a, _~_/_._s_s_h_/_i_d___e_c_d_s_a, _~_/_._s_s_h_/_i_d___e_d_2_5_5_1_9 and
     _~_/_._s_s_h_/_i_d_e_n_t_i_t_y.  After loading a private key, sssshh--aadddd will try to load
     corresponding certificate information from the filename obtained by
     appending _-_c_e_r_t_._p_u_b to the name of the private key file.  Alternative
     file names can be given on the command line.

     If any file requires a passphrase, sssshh--aadddd asks for the passphrase from
     the user.  The passphrase is read from the user's tty.  sssshh--aadddd retries
     the last passphrase if multiple identity files are given.

     The authentication agent must be running and the SSH_AUTH_SOCK environ‐
     ment variable must contain the name of its socket for sssshh--aadddd to work.

     The options are as follows:

     --cc      Indicates that added identities should be subject to confirmation
             before being used for authentication.  Confirmation is performed
             by ssh-askpass(1).  Successful confirmation is signaled by a zero
             exit status from ssh-askpass(1), rather than text entered into
             the requester.

     --DD      Deletes all identities from the agent.

     --dd      Instead of adding identities, removes identities from the agent.
             If sssshh--aadddd has been run without arguments, the keys for the
             default identities and their corresponding certificates will be
             removed.  Otherwise, the argument list will be interpreted as a
             list of paths to public key files to specify keys and certifi‐
             cates to be removed from the agent.  If no public key is found at
             a given path, sssshh--aadddd will append _._p_u_b and retry.

     --EE _f_i_n_g_e_r_p_r_i_n_t___h_a_s_h
             Specifies the hash algorithm used when displaying key finger‐
             prints.  Valid options are: “md5” and “sha256”.  The default is
             “sha256”.

     --ee _p_k_c_s_1_1
             Remove keys provided by the PKCS#11 shared library _p_k_c_s_1_1.

     --kk      When loading keys into or deleting keys from the agent, process
             plain private keys only and skip certificates.

     --LL      Lists public key parameters of all identities currently repre‐
             sented by the agent.

     --ll      Lists fingerprints of all identities currently represented by the
             agent.

     --ss _p_k_c_s_1_1
             Add keys provided by the PKCS#11 shared library _p_k_c_s_1_1.

     --tt _l_i_f_e
             Set a maximum lifetime when adding identities to an agent.  The
             lifetime may be specified in seconds or in a time format speci‐
             fied in sshd_config(5).

     --XX      Unlock the agent.

     --xx      Lock the agent with a password.

     DISPLAY and SSH_ASKPASS
             If sssshh--aadddd needs a passphrase, it will read the passphrase from
             the current terminal if it was run from a terminal.  If sssshh--aadddd
             does not have a terminal associated with it but DISPLAY and
             SSH_ASKPASS are set, it will execute the program specified by
             SSH_ASKPASS (by default “ssh-askpass”) and open an X11 window to
             read the passphrase.  This is particularly useful when calling
             sssshh--aadddd from a _._x_s_e_s_s_i_o_n or related script.  (Note that on some
             machines it may be necessary to redirect the input from _/_d_e_v_/_n_u_l_l
             to make this work.)

     SSH_AUTH_SOCK
             Identifies the path of a UNIX-domain socket used to communicate
             with the agent.

FFIILLEESS
     ~/.ssh/identity
             Contains the protocol version 1 RSA authentication identity of
             the user.

     ~/.ssh/id_dsa
             Contains the protocol version 2 DSA authentication identity of
             the user.

     ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa
             Contains the protocol version 2 ECDSA authentication identity of
             the user.

     ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
             Contains the protocol version 2 Ed25519 authentication identity
             of the user.

     ~/.ssh/id_rsa
             Contains the protocol version 2 RSA authentication identity of
             the user.

     Identity files should not be readable by anyone but the user.  Note that
     sssshh--aadddd ignores identity files if they are accessible by others.

EEXXIITT SSTTAATTUUSS
     Exit status is 0 on success, 1 if the specified command fails, and 2 if
     sssshh--aadddd is unable to contact the authentication agent.

AAUUTTHHOORRSS
     OpenSSH is a derivative of the original and free ssh 1.2.12 release by
     Tatu Ylonen.  Aaron Campbell, Bob Beck, Markus Friedl, Niels Provos, Theo
     de Raadt and Dug Song removed many bugs, re-added newer features and cre‐
     ated OpenSSH.  Markus Friedl contributed the support for SSH protocol
     versions 1.5 and 2.0.
